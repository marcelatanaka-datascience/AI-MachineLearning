# CONTENT BASED RECOMMENDATION

### This code was born to create a solution for product recommendation. Some of the math premisses are explained below.

#### Definition of cosine similarity
* Cosine similarity is a metric used to determine how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. 
* Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space.
* The smaller the angle the higher similarity
* In this context, the vectors are the arrays containing the word counts of a specific product.




## About datasets and examples
* All codes have a clean and customizable code for usage. __They don't have__ any specifications on their names.
* Archives with __BEER__ on its names contains code examples for the proposed algorithm.
* BEER dataset: its source is kaggle. You can download it raw and check it's credentials here: https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans
