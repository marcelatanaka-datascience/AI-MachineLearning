#### Definition of cosine similarity
* Cosine similarity is a metric used to determine how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. 
* Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space.
* The smaller the angle the higher similarity
* In this context, the vectors are the arrays containing the word counts of a specific product.
