# AI-MachineLearning
Here you will find some of my developments for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
The language used in most (if not all) projects are Python and you will find a lot of usage from most commonly known packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn and so on.

Please if you have any contributions, don't hesitate contacting me!
I hope you find this usefull.
