# AI-MachineLearning
Here you will find some of my developments for **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**. 

The language used in most (if not all) projects is **Python 3** and you will find a lot of usage from most commonly known packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, and so on.

Please if you have any contributions, don't hesitate to contact me!

I hope you find this useful.
